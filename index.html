    <h2>Remove First and Last Character Part Two</h2>
    <p>
        You are given a string containing a sequence of character sequences separated by commas.<br>
        <br>
        Write a function which returns a new string containing the same character sequences except <br>
        the first and the last ones but this time separated by spaces.<br>
        <br>
        If the input string is empty or the removal of the first and last items would cause the resulting <br>
        string to be empty, return an empty value (represented as a generic value NULL in the examples below).<br>
        <br>
        Examples<br>
        "1,2,3"      =>  "2"<br>
        "1,2,3,4"    =>  "2 3"<br>
        "1,2,3,4,5"  =>  "2 3 4"<br>
        <br>
        ""     =>  NULL<br>
        "1"    =>  NULL<br>
        "1,2"  =>  NULL<br>
    </p>
